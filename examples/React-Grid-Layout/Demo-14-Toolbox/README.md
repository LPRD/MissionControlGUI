This example is one of the React Grid Layout Demos. 
Demo 14 shows RGL functionality and how to use the toolbox, which lets you add and remove/minimize widgets/tiles 
from the main display using the clickable 'X' button.
Recompiling when the app is running appears to break the ability to move and resize.

To run:
```bash
npm -i
npm start
```
